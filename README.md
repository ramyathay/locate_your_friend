# locate_your_friend
Find your friend is an IOS app used to trace your friend's location in real time. In situations where there is a large crowd of people like at concerts, busy downtowns or new areas this app will be very helpful. The app also shows your current location, making it easier to find your friends location with respect to yours.

The real time location tracking is facilitated by sockets. The app is built on Swift language and uses Google Maps API to display the position on a map and also to get geo-coordinates.
